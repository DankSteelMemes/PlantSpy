This is designed to take a picture of something every 30 minutes and store the picture with the date and time it was taken as the file name. 

It uses a Neopixel stick to lioght the plant up for better pictures during the day time. It only uses ther Neopixel between 7 AM and 7 PM. I didn't want to confuse the plants I am taking pictures of and make them not grow as well as they could. This might not matter but I felt like it was the right thing to do.
